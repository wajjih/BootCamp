So setup a project structure such that,

1. there is a CheckersGame file and class within that (This is where you will start off your checkers game). For now 
the only thing in there should be the public static void main function.

2. there is a CheckersGamePiece class. This should only have 2 properties for now being type and color. 
Make the properties (or variables) public. 
Add 1 public method named getText to this class. It should return a string, "R" if the type is king and the color is red, "r" 
for normal piece, "B" for black king, "b" for black normal).

In the CheckersGame main function, create an instance of the CheckersGamePiece. Set the variables accordingly, then print the 
result of the getText.
