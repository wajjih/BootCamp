When doing encapsulation, the variables are private at the top while the rest of the classes and constructors use those variables
to set and get


ex:


public class Manager {
    
    private String name;
    private double height;
    private int age;
    
    public Manager(){
        height = 6.0;

    }
    
    public double getHeight(){
        return height;
    }
    public void setHeight(double height) {
        this.height = height;
